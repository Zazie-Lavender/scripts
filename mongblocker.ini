n0=;Mongblocker allows us to track mongs and dynamically ignore them based on activity. 
n1=;Each ignore is a 15 minute block, which should be unevadable based on their current address.
n2=;The Mong Blocker is meant to allow for idiots/spammers to be ignored for as long as we want,
n3=;without cluttering up the ignore list unnecessarily or having a huge list we can't manage
n4=;If we want an existing MongBlocker mask ignore to stick we just unset the -u (unset in) parameter in the
n5=;address book's ignore list.
n6=;With the correct masks however, you can detect your least favorite mongs and auto-ignore them
n7=;whenever they pop up...no matter what they change about their client info.
n8=;In future versions, we may pull a /who to determine their realname and match this...however
n9=;this will only allow detection of existing mongs if you specified their realname when adding them
n10=;Not sure how easily mIRC gets and stores GECOS info natively.
n11=;deduplicated some commands. Easier to debug if we're calling an alias to do what we need, we can debug that alias and debug entire script
